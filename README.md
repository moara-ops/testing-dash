# Metaverse Dashboard (Codename Iamus)

## deployment

A consideration for deployment is that this is an SPA (single page application) and therefore will require a simple server-side [configuration](https://router.vuejs.org/guide/essentials/history-mode.html) change in the case of a page refresh.

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
